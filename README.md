# SortingAlgorithms
//Andrew Yin, 1/2/2020 Update

The purpose of this project is to analyse the efficiency of various sorting algorithms that we learned in class. For each of the 8 implementations of the algorithms, different input sizes are tested with random inputs. Each test is performed 5 times to yield an average run time, and then a table is printed as output which displays the results of the test. 

Note: Mergesort has both an iterative and recursive implementation, both of which are tested here
